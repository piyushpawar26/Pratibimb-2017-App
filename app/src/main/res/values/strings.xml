    <string name="vjti_two">Under the World Bank grant - TEQIP - the institute has several projects underway to establish itself as a world class technological institute. The modernization will offer excellent central computing facilities to students, who will also have access to improved laboratory and workshop facilities. </string>

Pratibimb\'s Theme Launch followed by Pratibimb Mela kick started to the grand fest this year.Hundreds held their heart beats as the theme was unveiled!</string>
    <string name="str_aarambh_two">Our theme for the present edition is <b>TAKE 30-LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!</b> Pratibimb, just
like modern cinema has reached it\'s own destination, created it\'s own history and
has touched it\'s very own milestones.
Back in the year 1987, the onset of Pratibimb was a great unifying force, witnessing
it\'s journey from mute filmed to voice and from black and white to coloured in it\'s own
fashion. Analogous to the cinematic world, it has catered to the interests and talents
of many, working as a reformative instrument. After having 29 successful takes,
we\'re now gearing up for the massive 30th one!</string>
